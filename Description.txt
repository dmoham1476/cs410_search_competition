CS410 programming assignment 2 task2

I followed the nonprogramming based approaches for task2

1 Try different ranking functions and different parameters

I implemented tuning functions for the following ranking algorithms

a Okapi BM25  I tuned k1 b k3 parameters and the Max MAP  0618818 that was obtained was for k117  b07 k3800

b JelinekMercer  I tuned lambda parameter and the Max MAP  0595361 that was obtained was for Lambda  07

c Pivotedlength  I tuned the s parameter and the MAX MAP  0613185 that was obtained was for s  02

d DirichletPrior  I tuned mu parameter and the MAX MAP 0602803 that was obtained was for mu500

e MPtf2ln  From the paper  httpsifakacsuiuceduczhaipubtoisdiagpdf
The authors derived two new retrieval functions MPtf2ln and MDtf2ln
as improved versions of the pivoted length normalization retrieval function and the
Dirichlet prior retrieval function respectively and both have been shown to outperform
their corresponding original functions not only on the six data sets used to derive
them but also on two new data sets So I chose to implement and tune MPtf2ln

Varied and tuned the parameters to get a Max MAP  0625796 achieved by s  035 mu  500 alpha  06 lambda  075 This is the final outputtxt

2 I also tweaked the configtoml file for various filtering options as explained in the meta user guide for unigrams and bigrams The default filter option gave the best results

analyzers
method  ngramword
ngram  1
filter  defaultchain

3 Stopwords  I added more stopwords to the lemur_stopwordstxt but it made the MAP worse so I played around reducing some stopwords and it helped improve the maxMAP a bit
