Optimizing a Textual Search Engine with MeTa data sciences toolkit competition

Ranked 9th on the leaderboard for over 1000 submissions

Welcome to the UIUC's CS 410: Text Information Systems  Search Competition!
For this assignment, we have created a new data set, from Microsoft's Academic Search Engine, that contains abstracts and titles from published work in major IR conferences (called MAS data set).

You will learn how to create a test collection to evaluate a search engine, how to modify a search engine to improve its accuracy, and explore your own ideas to improve a search engine and "compete" with a baseline search engine.

We will use the test collection annotated by all the students to quantitatively evaluate your search engine. This public leader board will enable all the students to compete with each other in optimizing a search engine.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to use your netid as nickname.

IMPORTANT: The name of the submission file should be output.txt and prior to submitting it must be zip-archived. The final file format is output.txt.zip.

Wishing you all good luck!

We thank Microsoft for providing their Academic Knowledge API to create this data set.
